## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a student at Harvard University studying Computer Science with a language citation in Spanish. Here you can find some of my projects.

## Projects
<b>[CS51 Final Project](https://github.com/ArjonH/MiniML) </b>: This is my implementation for the MiniML final project for CS51 for Spring 2023.
(NOTE: this will only be public during Fall semester to ensure my code is not reused by future students.)

<b>[CS50 Final Project](https://github.com/ArjonH/LoveTest50) </b>: LoveTest50, a Flask website that allows users to solve love trianges and test compatibilites between individuals. My final project for CS50 for Fall 2021.
